# Hyrule Warriors Maps
Generator for JS-enabled tables for Hyrule Warriors's adventure maps

Based on [MetroWind's interactive maps](https://github.com/MetroWind/hyrule-warriors-maps). I would have forked, but I was planning on making so many changes that it didn't make sense to keep the commit history from their version. To further distance itself, I've written it from scratch, as MetroWind's version doesn't come even close to PEP8.

This generator uses Python code to create static HTML/JS files which will allow viewing all the information from (SBAllen)[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/community/SBAllen]'s (unlockables guide)[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/167257-hyrule-warriors-legends/faqs/73095] without having to scroll up and down or repeatedly going back to the beginning to click on a table cell. Instead, you can just hover over the table cell and it will display the information in a CSS/JS pop-up.
